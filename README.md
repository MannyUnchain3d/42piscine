# My 42 Piscine Journey

## Overview
The 42 Piscine is an intensive learning experience, serving as the gateway to 42's unique coding school. It's several weeks of immersive coding, where the conventional classroom setting is replaced by a practical, project-based approach and peer-to-peer learning.

## Learning Experience

### Deep Dive into C Programming
- The journey starts with the basics of shell scripting, but after a few days it quickly switches to C programming language, covering variables, loops, and functions.
- Progressively, it moves into more complex areas like pointers, data structures, memory management, and more.
- The curriculum is structured around daily exercises, friday exams, weekend team projects, each escalating in difficulty and complexity. An **8-HOUR** final exam comes as the finishing blow at the end of the 4 weeks.

### Collaborative Learning and Peer Feedback
- Collaboration is at the heart of the Piscine. Learning from and teaching peers is a fundamental part of the experience.
- Daily peer evaluations and group projects encourage communication and teamwork skills.

### Problem-Solving and Adaptability
- The Piscine's fast-paced nature requires quick thinking and adaptability.
- Regular challenges and exercises develop critical problem-solving skills, requiring innovative and efficient solutions.

### Personal Development
- Beyond technical skills, the Piscine fosters resilience, time management, and self-directed learning.
- The environment is challenging but supportive, pushing boundaries while encouraging personal growth.

## Conclusion
The 42 Piscine was a foundational experience, marking the start of my learning adventure at 42. It wasn't just about acquiring coding skills; it was an introduction to a new way of thinking and learning. This immersive experience set the stage for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the full program at 42, where the journey of growth and discovery in the coding world truly begins.
